Squirrel
=====

Squirrel is a MOOSE library for the Moltres and Zapdos applications, which are
geared towards molten salt reactor and laboratory low-temperature plasma
simulations respectively. Though different areas of physics, these applications
can share common pieces of code. It's only right that the great legendary birds
rely on the humble squirrel to survive.
